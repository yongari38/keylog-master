# keylog-master
still under development

"klog" folder contains program to record keystrokes and its timestamp

### Goal
Through collected data, train a model that can tell what the user typed with only the timestamps of keystroke.

Ultimately, with only the recorded sound of typing, extract the timestamps, then guess the sequence of keys.
